		<naslov1>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</naslov1> 
		<naslov2>How the story beggins</naslov2> 
		<tekst1>In the Second Age of Middle Earth, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom to conquer all. 
				An army of men and elves battle Sauron’s forces in Mordor, where King Isildur of Gondor slays Sauron,
				but the evil influence of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him from destroying it in Mount Doom. 
				Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost, found and owned by Gollum for five centuries. 
				The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.

		<naslov1>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</naslov1> 
		<naslov2>How the story beggins</naslov2> 
		<tekst1>Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue their journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring by throwing 
				it into Mount Doom. They are attacked in the night by Gollum, former owner of the Ring, but they capture 
				him. Sympathising with Gollum for their shared burden, Frodo asks Gollum to lead them safely to Mordor, 
				despite Sam’s objections. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the Uruk-hai who kidnapped their 
				friends Merry and Pippin. The Uruk-hai are slaughtered by the Rohirrim army of Rohan, but the two Hobbits 
				escape into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ent Treebeard.

		<naslov1>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</naslov1> 
		<naslov2>How the story beggins</naslov2> 
		<tekst1>Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden to Isengard where they reunite with Merry and 
				Pippin, who helped the Ents destroy Saruman's forces. With Saruman himself defeated, Gandalf retrieves 
				Saruman's palantír. Overcome by curiosity, Pippin steals a glance into the seeing-stone, and suffers an 
				immediate mental attack from Sauron himself. From what Pippin was able to recount, Gandalf deduces Sauron 
				will attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith, so he rides ahead to warn them, and takes Pippin with him 
				because Saron thinks Pippin to be the ring bearer.
